**What is GGIR?**

GGIR is an R-package to process multi-day raw accelerometer data for physical activity and sleep research. The term raw in raw accelerometry refers to data being expressed in m/s2 or gravitational acceleration as opposed to the previous generation accelerometers which stored data in accelerometer brand specific units. The signal processing includes automatic calibration, detection of sustained abnormally high values, detection of non-wear and calculation of average magnitude of dynamic acceleration based on a variety of metrics. Next, GGIR uses this information to describe the data per day of measurement or per measurement, including estimates of physical activity, inactivity and sleep.
